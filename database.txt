{"articleTitle":"DPI SHOW TWO 2022\r\n","articleBody":"The second show of thesis projects from the Class of 2022 opens March 30, 2022.\r\n\r\nSHOW II is an exhibition featuring works in photography, digital imaging, and multimedia by 22 graduating seniors from the Class of 2022 in New York University’s Department of Photography & Imaging at NYU Tisch School of the Arts.\r\n\r\nSHOW II is the second in a series of two BFA exhibitions of the work of the graduating Photography & Imaging class. It is installed in the Gulf + Western Gallery (1st floor rear lobby) and the 8th Floor Gallery at 721 Broadway (at Waverly Place). It will remain on view through May 18, 2022.\r\n\r\nThis exhibition presents 22 artistic thesis projects from this year's graduating class of the next generation of artists. Expanding across the first and eighth floor of NYU Tisch, the exhibition features everything from photographs, images, books, paintings and videos to sounds, installations, and interactive experiences. These artists in this year’s graduating class go above and beyond traditional notions of the photograph, blurring the lines between mediums, materials, and fields of knowledge, to redefine what it means to be a photographer, an artist, and a student in a constantly evolving world. Their work addresses contemporary themes of identity, the body, place, time, spirituality, technology, memory, and globalization and serves as their capstone project providing just a peek into what they’ve learned during their time at NYU, a school that fosters global perspectives and critical thinkers. Below are all the names and titles of the artists and their projects featured in this exhibition.","articleSummary":"","date":"4/25/2022, 2:09:57 AM","timestamp":1650866997249,"image":"/uploads/16463953e34a2849c053e22c0db8ddeb","_id":"bX9KjBiLafTuWet5"}
